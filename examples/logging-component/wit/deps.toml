# Dependencies for the logging component example
# Copy the WASI-TLS WIT files into your project or reference them directly

# Option 1: Use wasi-tls as a git dependency (recommended for production)
# tls = "git+https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-tls#main"

# Option 2: Use local path during development
tls = { path = "../../../wit" }

# Standard WASI dependencies
